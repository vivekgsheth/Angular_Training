How to get data in a dumb component (presenter component) 

Parent component can access data/method of child component in its template 

Parent component can access data/method of child component in its class 

Can we have a smart component inside another smart component 

do you fully understand sequence of ngOnChange and ngOnInit and contructor 

how components not related to each other communicate 




   Sequence of LifeCycle hooks 


    constrcutor() - 1 

      If component has @Input decorated property 

       constructor()-1 
       ngOnChanges() - 2
       ngOnInit() -3 
       ngOnChanges()
        ngOnchanges()  
       whenever value in any of @Input decorated properties change, ngOnChanges() will be called. 
  ngOnInit() is called only once 


      If component does not have @Input decorarted property 
        constructor() - 1
        ngOnInit() - 2 
      ngOnChanges() will not be called. 


Parent component can access data/method of child component in its template 
  template refernce variable 

Parent component can access data/method of child component in its class


  Child 1 - button1 
  Child 2 -  MyButton
  AppComponent 
 whenever user clicks on button1 of child1 , run a business logic in app component and on basis of that enable/disable mybutton of child2 component 

Child 1 - raise an event 
app component - call a function and on basis of that set a variable called ISCHILD2MYBUTTONENABLED 
You pass ISCHILD2MYBUTTONENABLED  in one of the @input decorated property of child 2 and in child 2 ngOnchanges() set local poperty and on basis of that in template [disabled] = ISCHILD2MYBUTTONENABLED  


Child 1 - raise an event 
app component - call a function and make child2 as @ViewChild in the app component itself chanmge the [disabled]  property 

Custom Attribute Directives 

1. credit card directive 
2. maps directives etc. 

Host - Element on which you apply the attribute dircetive
@HostListener() - To capture events raised on the host inside attribute directive 
@HostBinding() - To work with propertis of host inside attribute directive 

Example of hosts - input, table, div, maps
