-Server side tech - java,php,.net
-Client side tech - angular,react,vue

SPA - Single Page Applications

-Angular is used to create SPA which can be compiled as Web app or Mobile app(using tools like Ionic)

-Angular = (JS + CSS + HTML) = Client side tech

Typescript(a.ts)
-Created by Microsoft
-Created to reduce complexity of JS
-Browser do not understand TS
-Transpilation: a.ts ------> a.js (so that browser can understand) 
-tsc: Typescript compiler

Browser workflow:
1: Downloads the whole JS file
2: Interprets it
3: Executes it

Bundler(Webpack: used in angular):
-To bundle all js files in a single file

Modules in JS 2016:
-we can use other js files using: import math.js

Modules in Angular:
-Basic unit of compilation
-Creates scope
-It has one main module which will act as a strting point

Components:
-(TS + CSS + HTML)
-Must be a part of a module
-One main component

Angular CLI cmds:

1: Install node js
Check node version : node -v

2: Install angular-cli : npm install -g @angular/cli
Check angular version : ng --version

3:Create a new one: ng new app_name

4: To open in vs code : code .
 
5: To generate a new component : ng g c cmp_nm
ng g c cmp_nm --flat (will not create files in new folder rather it will create in pwd)

6: To generate eagerly loaded module : ng g m module_nm

7: To build : ng build

8: to compile & run : ng serve

9: Create a pipe : ng g pipe

devDependencies: dependencies which are not needed during production

tslint: coding std to be followed

@NgModule contents:
-declarations is used for components & pipes
-import array will contain shte modules to which our module is dependent upon

Module types:
1: Eagerly loaded(ng g m)
2: Lazy loaded

IMP: Module acts as a container so no unit test files are created for it. Whereas for components it will be created.

polyfills.ts
-detects the browser & converts the code into which older browser can understand (ES6)

tsconfig.json
-information abt typescript compiler
-in which js version it should compile

angular.json
-angular app config
-webpack config

After ng build: -------------> uses?
vendor.js: 
polyfills.js
main.js
runtime.js
styles.css



Queries:
-What is vendor.js ?
