Angular you can create forms in two ways 

1- template driven forms 

2- Reactive Forms 

in template driven forms all these validations are part of component template 
In a reactive forms all these validations are part of the component class 


control --- > FormControl 

FormControl takes three patamters 

1. initiatl value - nullable 

2. validation option - nullable , required , max length , min lenghth 

3. aysnc validators - 

You can map a control to an object on the class using the property binding [formControl]

You can check value -{{formcontrol.value}}
you can check status - {{formcontrol.status }} 


conntrol ---> formControl (
form -------> formGroup 

formBuilder --- > 

inital value 
validation 
async validator 

FormArray 



<app-user>

<app-login>


<app-login>

</app-user>

Conditional Validations

we need to find out value change on the form 

whethetr use is cliking on email or on password 

on basis of that apply conditional validation to phone number
