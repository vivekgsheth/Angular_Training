-----------------Forms---------------------
Types:
1> Template driven:
- All the validations are part of Component Template
- Difficult to bind with objects

2> Reactive
- All the validations are part of Component Class
- You can easily bind data with objects
- You can map a control to an object on the class using the property binding [formControl]
- You can check value & status  - {{formControl.value}} & {{formControl.status}}

Parameters of FormControl:
formState	
	-Initial value
validatorOpts
	-nullable required maxlength minlength
asyncValidatorFn:
	-EG:- We get error saying name already exists : whatever you enter gets verified with the DB or through API call with the server
	-The user will not feel stuck he can continue to enter other values while the name will be verified 


-To remove html validations: 'novalidate'

-FormBuilder: Service which will help to get FormGroup rather than creating with new & also useful when form gets lengthy
-Custom Validators
-Conditional Validations
-Template driven forms
