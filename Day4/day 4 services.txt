Share Data among multiple components which are not related to each other
Any common functionalities of your application, you should put in the service 

Directives are all about DOM 
Pipes are all about transform output on the DOM without changing input data
Services has nothing to do with DOM - Pure class without any template or HTML 

Since service is a class , so to use it you need to create an object of it. 

If we create a class for which only one object can be created. - Singelton 

Class A {} -- Component Foo 

  let a = new A(); 

let appservice = new AppService(); 


Service 

Step 1 : ng g s servicename (Create a service) 

Step 2 : Write functions inside the service (Implement the service) 

Step 3 : provideIn :root  (Provide the service) 
Step 4 : private appservice : AppService (Inject the service ) 

Step 5 : getData() -  (Use the service) 

Create --> Implement --> Provide --> Inject --> Use


Angular Service is a singelton class
Angular service is Tree-shakeable 


Hey what is the difference if I use provideIn or I use providers array 

You should use providers array if service is going to be used in dynamic loaded compoents/modules 

Service 1 - provideIn :'root'

Service 2 -  providIn :'root'
